# My Church Office - SaaS Office Application

## Overview

The My Church Office application or MCO was originally intended to provide the staff of Churches the tools they need to 
do their job. Many of the churches are still stuck in the past using old technology. We wanted to be able to provide the 
following: 

* Use new technology - SaaS website interface
* Solve current office problems or streamline existing ones.
* An easy to use interface for inputing data as well as creating reports on data that has been entered ovr time.
